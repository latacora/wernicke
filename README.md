![CI](https://github.com/latacora/wernicke/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A redaction tool for structured data. Run `wernicke` with JSON on stdin, get
redacted values out. Preserves structure and (to some extent) semantics. You
might want this because you have test data where the actual values are
sensitive. Because the changes are consistent within the data and the overall
data structure is preserved, there a better chance your data will stay suitable
for testing, even though it's been scrubbed.

Most people run wernicke on a shell, so you either have `json_producing_thing |
wernicke` or `wernicke < some_file.json > redacted.json`. EDN is also supported.
See `wernicke --help` for additional information.

IPs, MAC addresses, timestamps, various AWS identifiers, and a few other types of strings are redacted to strings of the same type: IPs to IPs, SGs to SGs, et cetera. If these strings have an alphanumeric id, that id will have the same length.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/latacora/wernicke/releases

## Configuration

We try to do something reasonable for most use cases. If you have a generally
useful redactions, please consider contributing them. However, sometimes
redaction behavior really does need to be configured. Pass an EDN literal on the
command line like so: `wernicke --config '{:some-rules "detailed below"}'`.

Right now this requires a pretty extensive understanding of how wernicke
works--we want to make this more accessible, though! If there's a specific thing
you want to accomplish, feel free to write a ticket.

### Adding extra rules

For example, to redact all numbers, add the following structure to your EDN:

```edn
{:extra-rules
  [{:name :numbers
    :type :regex
    :pattern "\\d*"}]}
```

The extra rules will be compiled before use, so e.g. you do not need to specify
the parsed regex structure for this to work.

### Disabling rules by name

Add the following structure to your EDN:

```edn
{:disabled-rules [:latacora.wernicke.patterns/arn-re]}
```

This still requires you to know what the rule names are. You can find these in
`latacora.wernicke.core/default-config`.

## Development

To run the project directly from a source checkout:

    $ clj -m latacora.wernicke.cli

To run the project's tests:

    $ clj -M:test

To build a native image:

    $ clj -M:native-image

(This requires GraalVM to be installed with SubstrateVM, and the `GRAAL_HOME`
environment variable to be set.)

## Namesake

Named after Carl Wernicke, a German physician who did research on the brain.
Wernicke's aphasia is a condition where patients demonstrate fluent speech with
intact syntax but with nonsense words. This tool is kind of like that: the
resulting structure is maintained but all the words are swapped out with
(internally consistent) nonsense.
